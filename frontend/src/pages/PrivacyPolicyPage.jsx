            Decorous (&ldquo;Decorous&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) operates the website
            {' '}<strong>decorous.in</strong> and provides construction, interior design and
            project management services in Bhubaneswar and across Odisha, India.
            This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect
            it, and how you can control it.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
          <h3>1.1 Information you give us</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Name, phone number, email address and city — collected through our enquiry forms, cost calculator and contact page.</li>
            <li>Plot size, construction type, budget range and project requirements — only if you choose to share them.</li>
            <li>WhatsApp messages and call records when you initiate contact with us.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>1.2 Information we collect automatically</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Device type, browser, IP address, referring URL and pages visited (via Google Analytics 4 and Google Ads, managed through Google Tag Manager).</li>
            <li>Cookies and pixel data for advertising attribution (Meta Pixel and Meta's Conversions API, used together to measure Facebook/Instagram ad performance).</li>
            <li>Anonymized on-site interaction data such as clicks and page navigation, used to understand and improve site usability (via PostHog).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To respond to your enquiry, schedule site visits and provide BOQs / cost estimates.</li>
            <li>To send service updates, project status and (occasionally) marketing communications you can opt out of.</li>
            <li>To measure site performance and improve our content and services.</li>
            <li>To prevent fraud, secure our systems and comply with legal obligations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Sharing of information</h2>
          <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We share information only with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Service providers who help us run the website (e.g. Google Analytics, MongoDB hosting, email providers) — bound by contractual confidentiality.</li>
            <li>Government or law enforcement bodies when legally required.</li>
            <li>Professional advisors (lawyers, auditors) under confidentiality obligations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain enquiry data for up to 36 months after your last interaction
            with us, so we can continue conversations and audit our marketing
            performance. You can request earlier deletion at any time
            (see Section&nbsp;7).
          </p>

          <h2>5. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS), access controls and
            backup procedures to protect your data. No method of transmission
            over the Internet is 100% secure — we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your personal information.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            When you first visit decorous.in, a banner asks whether you consent to
            non-essential cookies used for analytics and ad attribution (Google
            Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Pixel, PostHog). These do not load until you
            accept. You can change your choice at any time by clearing your
            browser's site data for decorous.in, which will show the banner again.
            You can also disable cookies entirely in your browser settings; doing
            so may impact site functionality.
          </p>
